# Reconstruction targets and performance (Days 2 and 3)

This section is dedicated to understand the output of the reconstruction chain and how it can be used to perform basic tasks:
- Analysis tools: How to load the output of the reconstruction chain in the analysis tools
- Michel electron: How to leverage semantic segmentation to tag Michel and reconstruct their energy
- Track dQ/dx: How to use Michels to tag stopping muon and to estimate their dQ/dx vs. residual range
- Track energy: How to reconstruct track energy from range and calorimetric information
- Shower enegry: How to reconstruct shower energy from calorimetric information
- Shower start dQ/dx: Use the shower start point reco. to estimate the shower start dQ/dx, a good e/gamma discrimination tool
- Primary ID and vertex reconstruction: How to use primary predictions to reconstruct the interaction vertex
- Particle identification: Understand the particle ID classifier output
